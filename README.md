# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero - Code Repository

This repository contains the code implementations corresponding to the YouTube tutorial series **"Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"**, which covers fundamental deep learning concepts and practical examples. The content mainly includes:

* Basic deep learning theory and model implementations
* Various classic neural network architectures (e.g.MLP,WaveNet)
* Tokenization techniques and their applications in large language models
* Basic architectures and training examples of large language models

This repository is designed to complement the video series, helping learners understand and practice core techniques in deep learning and large language models.
